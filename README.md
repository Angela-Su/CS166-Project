# CS166-Project

In this project we will model and build an Online Shopping Application for a Cafe. Users and
employees would be able to see the real-time changes on their orders, so we want to use a database
to support efficient data management. To attract customers, we are planning to show some of our
frequent customers our application with a friendly UI, having the database system as a back-end. We
will have three phases for this project: (i) requirements analysis using the ER-model, (ii) Relational
schema design, and (iii) implementation. Finally we will have a short presentation to the funders
(in this case course instructors) on all the functionalities of our system. The project will be done in
groups of two students.
